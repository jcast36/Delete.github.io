	My dog's name is <strong>Spark</strong>, he is a mixed breed of a cavalier and a shih tzu, called a 

	<em>
	"cavatzu".
	</em>

	I got him in 2012, when I was in 4th or 5th grade. He was the best gift ever given to me.

	His birthday is on September 9th, which is the same as my father. That makes him about a decade old. He's still walking and decently healthy, although he looks like a rat right now. His hair is kind of long and when we give him a bath he looks very old and raggedy T_T

	Spark loves to sleep and go on walks. He's a very curious dog, so he always tries to sniff and eat the grass. He is not a very social dog towards other dogs, but he's okay with people. He loves to greet you by the door and rub himself on you, but he doesn't like to be carried and hugged very much (although that doesn't stop me). He loves to eat and always guards his food when he thinks you're either going to feed him or take his food box away.
